## Fit for fingers

        <p>Touch aids users in understanding where they can physically interact with the screen simply and naturally.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Gestures

People often touch with more than one finger. Touch interactions should be similar no matter the number of fingers touching the screen.

Avoid interactions that require compound gestures such as double-tap or timed press-and-hold interactions. They are often triggered accidentally and are difficult to time correctly.

## Feedback

Increase users’ confidence by providing immediate visual feedback when they touch the screen. Interactive elements react by changing color, size or by moving.

## Targets

A well-designed touch experience balances size, spacing and visuals to make controls easier to press.

  </div>
  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li>
        Touch screens sense the geometric center of a user’s contact point.
      </li>
      <li>
       Users are imprecise in their movements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Touch targets are not visible and can be larger than the related visual element.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

    <img src="/img/targets-grid.svg">
  </div>
  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li>
            Frequently touched areas should have larger touch targets.
        </li>
        <li>
        A user interface element should be 60 to 100 percent of the touch target.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sequential tasks, such as multi-delete, require additional space for precision.
        </li>
        <li>
        Design grids provide adequate space between tangible user interface elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### Target sizes

There’s no perfect size for touch targets. Different sizes work for different situations. Actions with severe consequences or frequently used actions require large touch targets with enough padding to avoid accidental taps.

  <div class="usa-width-one-third">
    <img src="/img/targets-sizes.svg">
  </div>
  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li>
            7 by 7 mm is a good size if touching the wrong target can be corrected in one or two gestures.
        </li>
        <li>
        At 326 PPI, 90 px is equal to 7 mm.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Postures

Designing touch experiences requires knowledge of how the devices are held by different users. The user’s environment and physical comfort affect how long a grip is used and how often it’s changed.

  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li>
            Optimize the interface for different kinds of grips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Think about how landscape or portrait modes affect your content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Anchored thumbs increase touching accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Touching top of screen might knock a docked device off balance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Anything in the middle of the screen is difficult to reach.
        </li>
        <li>
            Interaction at a distance reduces readability and accuracy.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### Interaction areas

Tablets are most often held along the side, making the bottom corners ideal for interactive elements. Most users hold a tablet with the left hand and touch it with the right. Place interactive elements within reach of the thumbs.

### Reading areas

Content in the top half of the screen is easier to see than content on the bottom half where it can be blocked by the hands or ignored.
